# grocery-store
Application that manages grocery store shopping list - focus on looping and arrays in C#.


1. Created a new GroceryList.cs file with a GroceryList class name, a Main() method, and an array of grocery list items.

2. The line foreach (string groceryItem in myGroceryList) can be read as "for each item in myGroceryList, name it groceryItem, then run the line of code between the curly braces." 
   Application is printing each item in myGroceryList to the console.

3. Added functionality to keep track of our grocery trip's cost by looping through array.

4. Created a second array int[] groceryListPrices to store the prices of myGroceryList items.

5. Created a new int variable named total and set it to 0. 

6. Updated total to equal total + price inside the loop. Price represents one item in groceryListPrices as the foreach loop goes through each item in the array.
